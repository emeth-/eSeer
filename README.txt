Enter in an email to receive notifications, an image url to display in the email (or use the default transparent png), and a message to be displayed in the notification email to let you know what the notification is for.

Two image urls will be generated. One is a php script masked as a .png (or other image extension) file by .htaccess. The other is for you if .htaccess doesn't work on your server.

Take the url, and embed it in an html email to someone.

Now, when they open the email (assuming they have html emails enabled) you'll receive a notification!.
